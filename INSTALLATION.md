# Quick Installation Guide

The fastest way to get set up using package managers.

---

## What You Need

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **Node.js 16+** (npm comes with it automatically)
3. **Git**

---

## macOS - Use Homebrew

### 1. Install Homebrew (if you don't have it)

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### 2. Install Everything

```bash
# Install Python, Node.js, and Git all at once
brew install python3 node git
```

That's it! Homebrew installs Python, Node.js (with npm), and Git in one command.

### 3. Verify

```bash
python3 --version
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

---

## Windows - Use Winget

Winget comes pre-installed on Windows 10/11!

### 1. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt

Search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu and run as Administrator.

### 2. Install Everything

```powershell
# Install Python
winget install Python.Python.3.12

# Install Node.js (includes npm)
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS

# Install Git
winget install Git.Git
```

### 3. Restart your terminal and verify

Close PowerShell and open a new one, then:

```powershell
python --version
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

**Note:** If `python` doesn't work, try `python3` or `py`.

## Troubleshooting

### Winget not found (Windows)

Update Windows to the latest version. Winget comes with Windows 10 (version 1809+) and Windows 11.

### Homebrew installation fails (macOS)

Make sure Command Line Tools are installed:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### "Command not found" after installation

Close and reopen your terminal, then try again.

## Why Package Managers?

- **Fast:** One command installs everything
- **Easy:** No clicking through installers
- **Updates:** Easy to update (`brew upgrade` or `winget upgrade`)
- **Clean:** Easy to uninstall (`brew uninstall` or `winget uninstall`)

That's it! See the main [README.md](README.md) for more details about the project.
