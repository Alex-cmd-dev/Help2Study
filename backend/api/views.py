API VIEWS - The "Kitchen Staff" in our Restaurant

Views are request handlers - they receive HTTP requests, process them, and return responses.
This is where the business logic lives!

ROLE IN REQUEST CYCLE:
1. Request arrives â†’ Django routing sends it here (via urls.py)
2. View authenticates user (checks JWT token)
3. View validates data (using serializers)
4. View interacts with database (via models/ORM)
5. View prepares response and sends back JSON

CONCEPTS: REST API, HTTP Methods, Class-Based Views, Authentication, CRUD
RELATED: urls.py (routes to these views), models.py (database), serializers.py (validation)

# LOGGING SETUP FOR PRESENTATION & DEBUGGING
# ============================================
# Logger for tracking request journey through the system
#
# WHY LOGGING IS IMPORTANT:
# 1. DEBUGGING: Helps identify where errors occur in the request flow
# 2. MONITORING: Track system behavior in production
# 3. LEARNING: Visualize how data moves through the application
# 4. PERFORMANCE: Measure how long operations take
#
# HOW TO USE:
# - logger.info() for normal operations (what we use for presentations)
# - logger.warning() for concerning but non-critical issues
# - logger.error() for errors that need attention
# - logger.debug() for detailed debugging info
#
# WHERE TO VIEW: When you run `python manage.py runserver`,
# logs appear in the terminal with ðŸ”µ markers for easy tracking
#
# FUTURE USE: In production, logs go to files or monitoring services
# like AWS CloudWatch, DataDog, or Sentry for real-time alerts
