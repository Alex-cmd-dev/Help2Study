API VIEWS - The "Kitchen Staff" in our Restaurant

Views are request handlers - they receive HTTP requests, process them, and return responses.
This is where the business logic lives!

ROLE IN REQUEST CYCLE:
1. Request arrives â†’ Django routing sends it here (via urls.py)
2. View authenticates user (checks JWT token)
3. View validates data (using serializers)
4. View interacts with database (via models/ORM)
5. View prepares response and sends back JSON

CONCEPTS: REST API, HTTP Methods, Class-Based Views, Authentication, CRUD
RELATED: urls.py (routes to these views), models.py (database), serializers.py (validation)
