SERIALIZERS - The "Translators" in our Restaurant

Serializers convert data between formats:
- Python objects â†’ JSON (for API responses)
- JSON â†’ Python objects (for incoming requests)

They also validate incoming data before it reaches the database.

ROLE IN REQUEST CYCLE:
- REQUEST: JSON â†’ Serializer validates â†’ Python object â†’ Saved to DB
- RESPONSE: DB query â†’ Python object â†’ Serializer â†’ JSON

CONCEPTS: Serialization, Data Validation, JSON conversion
RELATED: views.py (uses serializers), models.py (source of data)

# ============================================
# LOGGING FOR DATA TRANSFORMATION TRACKING
# ============================================
# Logger for tracking how data changes format as it moves through the system
#
# WHY LOG IN SERIALIZERS:
# Serializers are the "translators" that convert data between formats.
# Logging here helps you see:
# - What the Python object looks like before conversion
# - What the JSON looks like after conversion
# - Any data transformations or calculations that happen
#
# REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:
# When you call an API endpoint, you want to verify the exact JSON
# being sent to the frontend. Logging in serializers shows you this!
#
# FUTURE USE: In production, you might log to track:
# - What data users are accessing
# - How often certain fields are null
# - Performance issues with large datasets
